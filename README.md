# INSAT-3D-Data-Analysis
It contains analysis of data from Imager and Sounder onboard the INSAT-3D satellite. I've used some modules and features for the first time here. 

Most files in this repo are not structured. Most of the stuff were hit and trials, I was learning how to deal with hdf data format, how to plot them with proper georeferencing.
